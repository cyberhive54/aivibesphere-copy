The project focused on Phase 1: Database and Core Data Model Enhancements. This involved significant updates to the Supabase schema, including the expansion of the tool_category enum with numerous new categories (e.g., content_creation, image_generation, healthcare, travel), and the addition of new columns to the tools table (e.g., is_trending, is_just_launched, social_media_links, faq, analytics_data). Crucially, several new tables were introduced to support expanded functionality: user_favorites, deals, feature_requests, bug_reports, advertisements, and category_features, each with appropriate Row Level Security (RLS) policies and indexes.

Following the completion of Phase 1, Phase 2: Core Feature Implementations & UI Updates was addressed. This phase integrated centralized category management across various components, implemented a debounced view count increment for tools, and introduced a comprehensive favorites/bookmarking feature for users, including a dedicated "My Favorites" page. Conceptual discussions around Stripe integration and enhanced authentication (Google/GitHub sign-in, forgot password functionality) were also part of this phase. UI improvements included a global "Scroll to Top" button, custom scrollbars, and an updated footer with new navigation links.

The project then moved into Phase 3: New Pages & Navigation. This phase saw the creation and integration of several new pages into the application's routing, such as:

A dedicated "My Favorites" page (UserFavoritesPage).
"Trending Tools" and "Just Launched" pages (TrendingToolsPage, JustLaunchedPage) to showcase popular and newly added AI tools.
A "Deals & Offers" page (DealsPage) to display exclusive discounts.
A comprehensive "AI Tools Directory" page (ToolDirectoryPage) with search and infinite scrolling.
A "Request a Feature" page (RequestFeaturePage) for user suggestions. The main header navigation was also updated to include links to these new sections.
Currently, Phases 1, 2, and 3 have been successfully implemented. The conversation is now poised to begin implementing parts of Phase 4: Tool Details Page Enhancements.
